# Discord-Telegram-Mirror

Discord-Telegram-Mirror is a tool designed to mirror messages from Discord to Telegram. It offers flexible configuration options, allowing you to monitor specific channels, entire servers, or even whole accounts. You can fine-tune each channel or server setting to direct your messages to different Telegram chats and threads based on their origin.

## Installation

To install the tool, run the below commands in the location you want to install it:

```
git clone https://github.com/quo0001/Discord-Telegram-Mirror.git
cd Discord-Telegram-Mirror
```

## Usage

1. Input your Telegram and Discord credentials in the data/config.json file. The Discord token can be sourced from either a user or bot account.
2. Set rules for which servers or channels to monitor, along with their corresponding output chat and thread IDs. Note: If you want to mirror an entire account, you can use a wildcard ("\*") as the ID for either a guild or channel rule. All servers/channels without a specific rule will automatically be forwarded to the wildcardâ€™s output chat.
3. Run the cmd/Discord-Telegram-Monitor/main.go file and watch your Telegram chats fill up with incoming messages!
